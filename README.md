# Embedded-Building-Entry-Controller-System-Simulation
Project Description:
- Designed and implemented a building entry controller system simulation, showcasing expertise in real-time programming and embedded integration concepts.
- Developed programs to emulate a two-door system with card scanners and a controller, aligning with the requirements of the QNX software stack development.
- Integrated message passing protocols between scanners and the controller for door opening requests, ensuring seamless communication and integration similar to QNX Vertical Platform products.
- Implemented a locking mechanism to ensure only one person can enter the lock at a time, demonstrating proficiency in embedded systems and safety considerations.
- Utilized event-driven programming to handle door status changes and coordinate door operations efficiently, reflecting familiarity with embedded OS and middleware components.
- Created a testing harness to simulate various scenarios and validate system functionality, mirroring the testing and quality assurance responsibilities outlined in the job description.
- Conducted unit testing for individual components and integration testing for the entire system, in line with the continuous integration build systems mentioned in the job requirements.
- Provided clear documentation outlining system architecture, component interactions, and usage instructions, adhering to workplace operating procedures and guidelines.
- Summarized design decisions, implementation details, and testing results in a comprehensive project report, demonstrating attention to detail and adherence to formal test theory and methodology.
